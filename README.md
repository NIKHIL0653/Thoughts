# Thoughts
 Contains all files/folders used to build a blogging website, it allows user to register, login to their account, write and publish their own blogs and view it on a main blogs page. I have used avien for the database, cloudflare-workers for the backend part, user authentication is done by jwt and react with tailwind along with flowbite in frontend
